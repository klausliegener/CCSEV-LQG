Cosmological Coherent State Expectation Values in LQG


### Content
This project contains all relevant files to evaluate the expectation values of polynomial operators in cosmological coherent states (prerequirement: mathematica).

[A] Introduction.pdf - contains a description of and guide to the code

[B] Main.nb - contains the implementation of the algorithm from [1] as a mathematica notebook

[C] Main.m - contains the implementation of the algorithm from [1] as a pre-compiled mathematica file

[D] DiracQ_mod.m - contains a slightly modified version of [2],  the DiracQ package by jgwright1986
